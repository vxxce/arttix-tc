## About
This application was created for ArtTix. It calculates a shift's duration and rounds it to the nearest quarter-hour per ArtTix reporting requirements.

## Usage
Works best in Chrome/chromium or Firefox. Okay in Safari. Works in Edge, but interface is lacking and you must use 24-hr time. Internet Explorer is not supported.
